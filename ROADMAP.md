# Roadmap and Design Goals
These are things I want to implement at some point (Things might get added to this list over time)

## Must Features
These are the features that need to be in the mod before I consider it "done" and a 1.0 release happens. 

### The Desert
- The desert of Arrakis is spotted with rocks, where you are safe from most dangers (Especially the worms). Build your facotries here.
- The sand of the desert carries noise, which attracts worms wich live in the deep desert. The sand is also always moving due to the stoms and so you cannot build here easily. Only with the help of the expensive foundations you can place buildings.

### Sand storms
Heavy storms ravage the surface of Arrakis, damaging buildings and people. The only protection against them are shield walls, but be careful, they attract worms.

### Sand worms
The sandworms usually live deep under the sand. You don't encounter them normally. But if you start to make too much noise in the sand, they will come. If you build on the desert sand (with foundations) you will attract the worms. They find their prey through sound and so they will devour your factory. They will appear from the sand like a tidal wave of destruction.  Unless you know the Fremen way, even walking across the desert can attract worms. And they are quick.  
Unfortunatly for any stranded engineer, they are also incredibly hard to kill. Almost immune to forms of attack. Their only weakness is water which is poison to them, but it is likely the rarest substance on Arrakis.  

### Spice Melange
The rarest and most valuable substance in the universe. It allows faster than light travel and over logic defying capabilities of the mind. It is created by the Sandtrout deep under the sand and released to the surface in an explosion - the spice blow. The wind carry it away and so you need to be quick (but not too quick as a spice blow is deadly). Harvesting is difficult, as spice blows can happen anywhere in the deep desert at any time. And once you're there, you won't have long until the worms are attracted by your disturbance.

### The water of life
When a Sandworm dies from water poisoning, it creates a liquid called the water of life. A regual person drinking it, it is highly lethal, but for a prepared and trained person it unlocks an ancestral memory. Luckily you don't have to kill a sand worm to get it. The bile produced by a young sandworm can be converted into the water of life.

### The Holtzman effect
The holtzman effect is used to great effect in the universe of Dune. It allows faster than light travel, shields, and much more. Using this effect you will be able to fold space with a new drive for spaceships. You can travel with much less fuel and without encountering asteroids.

### FTL Travel
To travel faster than light you not only need to make use of the holtzman effect but also make sure you are not crashing into things. For this spice is used. Spice allows the navigators to expand their minds and calculate a safe path.

### New Buildings / Structures / Items
To make use of all that Arrakis has to offer, there are going to be some new buildings, structures and items. Among those are:  
- Moisture Farm
  - It collects small amounts of water from the air
- Harvester
  - The harvester mines the spice from the sand
  - It can escape from worms
- Capturing Spice Trout
  - Using water in the desert you can attract sand trout
  - If captured and provided with water, they gather into a new sandworm
- Captured Young Sand Worm
  - Capturing and holding a young sandworm to harvest the water of life from it.
- Shield Wall
  - Projectors to create a shield wall, to be safe from the sand storms
- Spice Melange
- Melange Science
  - A new science pack used to research powerful and expensive technologies
  - Lazeguns (Laser turrets / equipment Mk2)
  - Holtzman Shields (Personal Shields Mk3)
  - Faster than Light Travel (avoiding asteroids)


## Maybe Features
These are features I might add, but they do not have priority.

### Buildings / Structures / Items
- Seismic detector
  - To be able to harvest sand, you need to know where spice blows occour, luckily it generates seismic waves you can measure.
  - Worms coming close to the surface also create seismic waves. So you get a warming of the worms.
