# Arrakis
(Early Alpha Version)

Planet Arrakis is a mod for factorio which aims to eventually add the planet Arraks aka. Dune to the game.

Arrakis is one of the most legendary planets in all of fiction.   
Originally created by Frank Herbert for the Novel Dune, this mod tries to eventually put Arrakis - also known as Dune - into factorio.  

Arrakis is a desert planet almost completely devoid of water.  
Sandworms (or Shai-Hulud) roam the planet and attack anything moving. But unlike the demolishers of Vulcanus, we cannot just kill. If they die then with them vanishes the valuable Spice Melange. It is the most valuable substance in the universe and only found on Dune. It allows the guild navigators (and eventually you too) to travel at speeds greater than the speed of light.
